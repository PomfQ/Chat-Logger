# KoGaMa Chat Monitor

A Python-based tool designed to **monitor in-game chat traffic** in KoGaMa by targeting specific UDP packets. While functional, the tool is **not 100% accurate** and may occasionally display false or partial information ‚Äî use with caution.

---

## [üßæ] Requirements

```
pip install colorama
pip install scapy
```

[NpCap](https://npcap.com/) Must be installed

## [‚öôÔ∏è] How It Works

- **Target Port**: Listens to KoGaMa‚Äôs UDP traffic on port `5055`, specifically connected to the following server IPs:
  - `85.17.83.193`
  - `85.17.124.179`

- **Packet Detection**: Filters and processes packets containing the `CHAT_HEADER`, defined as:
``b"\x62\x05\x73\x00"``

- **Decoding**:
- `latin1` is used for standard Latin-based characters.
- `utf-8` is used for decoding **non-Latin scripts** (such as Arabic, Cyrillic, Chinese, etc.).

- **Output Format**:  
Messages are printed to the console in the format:
[Username] : [Message]


If the username is unavailable, the script will fall back to displaying the actor ID:
[Actor_1] : [Message]

- **Private Chat Support**:  
This tool can also capture **private chat traffic**, including **Team chat**

---

## [‚ö†Ô∏è] Limitations

- The script **cannot resolve usernames** for players who were already in the session **before** it was launched.
- However, it will still display their **actor ID** when they send messages.
